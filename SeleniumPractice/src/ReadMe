Installation/ Changes:

Install JDK and eclipse
Import Selenium, Maven and TESTNG jar files.
FlipkartHomePage is the driver class
Change the path of the Gecko driver and chrome driver (path = where the respective exe files are installed into the system)

To Run:

Testng.xml -> Run As -> TestNG suite

Roles:

LoginPage.java : code for login into Flipkart. 
ElectronicMobile.java: whole logic resides there. Filtering the Mobile section and adding the
					final to the cart.
FlipkartHomePage.java: Driver page. Responsible for Calling Login.java and ElectronicMobile.java.
Configuration/Config.property : It has username and password. You can pass the parametes to the program from this file.
Data/ConfigurationClass.java: Responsible for reading data from Config.property and passing it to the program

Challenges Faced:

the locator issues in Flipkart site. The Web elements dont have ID, Name or any unique tags.
I have to use xpath for identifying the elements (which is not a good way of programming) and the xpaths
are unstable too.
